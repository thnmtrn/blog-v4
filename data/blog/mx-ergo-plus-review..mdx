I've been using the M570 for years now and I loved it. In my opinion, it is one of the best starter trackball mice. It is extremely ergonomic, easy to use, and affordable at around $40. 

My biggest problem with the M570 was the scroll wheel. During my workflow, the mouse just didnt have enough features to speed up my process. But many times the scroll wheel slowed me down. which is why i chose to upgrade to the MX Ergo plus.
